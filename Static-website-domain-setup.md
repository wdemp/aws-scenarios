Explanation: During the creation process I encountered various issues ranging from technical problems to human error problems. I forgoet
about modifying the public access feature in S3; in addition to incorporating DNS options from the Route 53 service. Another issue 
that I ran into was uploading the files into S3. The read out indicated that nothing was uploaded successfully; however once I opened
up the option and opened the file containing the needed files I simply "selected all the files in the folder and draged and dropped them 
into the upload box.
